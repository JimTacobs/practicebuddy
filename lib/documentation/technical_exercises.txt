For technical exercises, it's important to learn from the user how long they take to complete a
technical exercise, because the amount of technical exercises done in a day is linked to the time
they have designated to practicing them.

Thus, for each technical exercise keep track of the length of each practice session. We want to
create an average for the first practice, numbers 2-5, numbers 5-10 and 11+. Each exercise will
have an array of ints linked to it, which represents how long each session took. When updating this
list, we also immediately update the central array which corresponds with this practice session's n.
It will be very easy to get the average of this central array, thus making it easy to make a good
assumption about the work the user is able to get done in the time they have reserved for technical
exercises.
