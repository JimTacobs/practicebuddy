At the start of their daily practice, the user sees a list of all the pieces (and technical
exercises) that are due for today. These will be listed in a logical order and they can either tap
whichever piece they want to start with, or click the big old 'start practice' button.

When the user taps a piece, they are shown the first chunk for that piece of the day. While these
are generally oredred by due date, things do get a bit more complicated.

As long as there are new measures to learn, there must at least be some new measures every day. How
many wholly depends on the amount of practice the user plans on doing on a daily basis. I think two
sessions a day of practicing a new piece is realistic, at least until the user is able to play every
measure with the metronome. After this point, the intensity with which the piece is practiced
rapidly decreases. It also gets spread out more naturally.

Repetition of material the user is getting from a tempo of null to their lower threshold is the
most important. The user is still struggling with the measures within this chunk, so reinforcing it
is key to getting it in their fingers.

Then comes repetition of material the user has played successfully with a metronome. The more
familiar the measures within the chunk are, the lower the priority.

There must be a balance between learning new things and reinforcing old things. Once a new piece is
started, at least some effort must be made to learn some new things every day. At the same time,
learning a new piece should never be at the cost of mastery towards the things you're currently
learning.
