When creating a composer, the user is asked to provide as much information about them as possible.
For the time being, I will add a load of composers already.

Of a composer, I want to know the following details:
- First name(s)
- Last name
- Date of birth
- Date of death (if applicable)


I will upload a bunch of assets, which I will attempt to keep small, to show the face of the
composer on different places. Make the image small (height + width) to not let the app get huge.

A composer will also have works. Each work will be assigned to an instrument, so the app can be used
for every instrument, not just the piano.
